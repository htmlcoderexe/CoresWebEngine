## what is this?

I think I started writing this 10 or more years ago, back with PHP 5 something and using MySQL raw. So this is already better than that!

This is written in PHP, and despite what both netbeans and apparently GitHub too are attempting to convince me of, there isn't a single "Smarty" template in the whole project.

I actually had to Google to find out what the hell a smarty even is. Turns out, my templates use a similar enough syntax (and share the very unique and creative extension .tpl (it stands for Totally Private L... uh something)) that I let netbeans play its little game because the syntax highlighting sometimes even matches what it probably should have been.

This was made way before I knew there were any other kinds of smarties except for the ones that you eat, the syntax was actually inspired by Wikipedia's markup.

Anyway.... 

### Features

* The above mentioned templating engine - never embed HTML in your PHP ever again (you can sorta embed PHP into the templates if you must, though)

* Entity-Attribute-Value system - named EVA because I had a thing for giving human names to my projects if I could shoehorn it in

* Users, logins, permissions, all the garbage you probably will want at some point in your system

* Modular system - it's relatively easy to add a new URL that does something new. Apparently I was doing MVC before I knew what that was.

* Some currently developing and included modules include a file store system, a calendar, documents and probably other stuff I forgot to give a damn about

### Documentation

Still reading this? This is techincally docoumentation, too, but I digress.

Not really much else. Some empty files in a documentation folder have been added to remind me to add later.
